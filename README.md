MultiModelSpreadPredictor
MultiModelSpreadPredictor is a hybrid machine learning pipeline designed for predicting spreads between financial contracts. It integrates several advanced modeling techniques, including Hidden Markov Models, Support Vector Machines, and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The repository demonstrates a complete workflow for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to forecast contract spreads effectively.

Features
Hidden Markov Models (HMM):
Identifies hidden states of the market and generates state likelihood features.
Support Vector Machines (SVM):
Predicts the direction (rise or fall) of contract spreads using binary classification.
LSTM Neural Network:
Models the magnitude of spreads by leveraging sequential dependencies and features generated by HMM and SVM.
Comprehensive Feature Engineering:
Incorporates lagged features, technical indicators, streak calculations, and seasonality adjustments.
Evaluation Metrics:
Includes RMSE, MAE, R², maximum drawdown, and Sharpe ratio to assess model performance.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MultiModelSpreadPredictor.git
cd MultiModelSpreadPredictor
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Examines the structure, trends, and distributions of the contract data.
Handles missing values using forward-fill and spreads-based imputation.
Flags outliers with dummy features for integration into models.
2. Feature Engineering
Constructs technical indicators (e.g., MACD, RSI) and rolling statistics.
Computes spreads, ratios, and autocorrelation for lagged relationships.
Encodes seasonality using monthly dummy variables.
3. Modeling Pipeline
HMM: Identifies hidden states to capture market regimes.
SVM: Predicts directional changes in spreads.
LSTM: Utilizes historical data and derived features for spread level forecasting.
4. Evaluation
Analyzes prediction performance through visualizations and metrics.
Measures model risk via maximum drawdown (absolute and relative).
Assesses strategy performance using the Sharpe ratio.
Results
Prediction Accuracy:
The SVM and LSTM models achieve robust directional and magnitude forecasts, validated using time-series splits.
Evaluation Metrics:
LSTM models achieve R² values up to 0.9 and low MAE, confirming strong generalization across folds.
Risk and Return:
Maximum drawdowns and Sharpe ratios illustrate model viability under trading strategies.
